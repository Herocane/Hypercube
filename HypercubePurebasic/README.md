Hypercube Classic Minecraft Software
====================================

This folder's contents is the Purebasic edition of the program. It may need updating.

It includes the works of Dadido3 and Umby24.

Dadido3's code specifically is used for the ZLib.pbi and NBT.pbi files.

UmbyNBT.pbi is my re-written version of D3's NBT, that (might) eventually replace D3's version.


This is to be seen.


All code here is available to you under the MIT Licence, same as in the base folder.
